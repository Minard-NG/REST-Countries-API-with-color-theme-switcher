# Country Navigator

In this project, I explored the asynchronous nature of JavaScript. For this project, I integrated with the famous REST Countries API to pull country data and display it nicely for easy use by users. I also, added a theme switcher and subtle transition effects to improve user experience.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass/Scss
- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub

### What I learned

In this project, I tested out a fluid typography concept (__just for font sizes__) to help reduce the media queries. In the code snippet below, the base font-size is a non-responsive css unit(__such as px__),while the flexible font-size is a responsive unit(__such as vw__); 

```css
.selector{
  font-size: calc(base font-size + flexible font-size)
}
```



To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
